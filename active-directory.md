## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNOLOGY & TOOLS UTILIZED

- **`VirtualBox:`**  
  Used as the primary virtualization platform to host multiple virtual machines in an isolated local environment for cybersecurity testing and infrastructure simulation.

- **`Windows Server 2019:`**  
  Deployed as the domain controller within the lab. Configured to run Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), DNS, and Group Policy to emulate enterprise-level identity and access management scenarios.

- **`Windows 10:`**  
  Installed as a domain-joined workstation to simulate a typical enterprise endpoint. Used for user behavior simulation, GPO testing, and endpoint visibility through logging tools.

- **`Active Directory:`**  
  Implemented to manage user accounts, groups, and organizational units (OUs). Used for hands-on experience with authentication flows, access control, privilege escalation testing, and administrative scripting.

- **`PowerShell:`**  
  Used for automating administrative tasks such as creating users, managing AD objects, and configuring system settings within both the server and client machines.
  
- **`Group Policy Management:`**  
  Applied GPOs to enforce password policies, audit policies, restrict user privileges, and configure security baselines across the domain environment.

## OBJECTIVE

Designed and deployed a virtualized Windows domain lab using `VirtualBox`, `Windows Server 2019`, and `Windows 10` to gain hands-on experience with enterprise network infrastructure and identity management. The project focused on configuring `Active Directory`, `Group Policy`, and domain-joined `endpoints` to simulate real-world authentication, access control, and administrative workflows. This lab environment served as a foundation for practicing common security tasks, including privilege escalation prevention, user access auditing, and scripting automation with `PowerShell`.

## üë£ STEP-BY-STEP: SETTING UP THE DOMAIN CONTROLLER

### Step 1: `Virtual Machine` Creation and Provisioning

The virtual machine, named `Domain-Controller`, was configured as a domain controller using the `Windows Server 2019 ISO`. It was provisioned with 2 GB of RAM and 4 virtual CPUs to support `Active Directory` and core infrastructure services.

---

### Step 2: Configure `Network Adapters`

For networking, `Network Adapter 1` was enabled and attached to `NAT` to allow internet access. `Network Adapter 2` was connected to an `internal network` named `Test 3` to facilitate isolated communication between lab machines without external exposure.

<img width="1134" height="472" alt="Lab 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06246298-cf3c-4f36-b51d-e89544dc861c" /></br>

---

### Step 3: `Windows Setup`

Powered on the virtual machine and proceeded through the Windows Server 2019 installation process using the ISO image.

---

### Step 4: Check `Network Configuration`

Checked the `network connection details` of the virtual machine and observed it was automatically assigned an IPv4 address of `169.254.120.207`, indicating an `APIPA` (Automatic Private IP Addressing) address.

<img width="357" height="434" alt="Lab 9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45c3d59a-f363-406e-b31b-a33ed6a64961" /></br>

Under `Network Connections`, we renamed the NAT adapter to `Internet` and the internal network adapter to `Internal_Network` for better clarity. The `Internet_Network` adapter was then manually configured with the following static IP settings:  
- **IP address:** `172.16.0.1`  
- **Subnet mask:** `255.255.255.0`  
- **Preferred DNS server:** `127.0.0.1`

---

### Step 5: Set Up `Active Directory`

In `Server Manager`, we began by launching the `Add Roles and Features` Wizard to install `Active Directory Domain Services` (AD DS). During the setup, we also included `Group Policy Management` and `Remote Server Administration Tools` (RSAT) to enable centralized domain control and administrative functionality.

<img width="1001" height="741" alt="Lab 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5771a04-7c98-4775-b2da-d8c923f4b627" /></br>

After completing the role installation, we proceeded with the `post-deployment configuration` by promoting the server to a domain controller. During the configuration, we created a new forest with the root domain name `mydomain.com`, and enabled both the `Domain Name System` (DNS) server and `Global Catalog` (GC) options. We also set the NetBIOS domain name to `MYDOMAIN`.

<img width="1227" height="764" alt="Lab 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba1b4759-d514-4bc1-9d9b-f6541081624d" /></br>

---

### Step 6: Set up `Domain Admins` and `Domain Users`

After logging back into the server, we navigated to `Active Directory Users and Computers` to begin configuring domain objects. We created a new `Organizational Unit` (OU) named `_ADMINS`, and within that OU, added a new user account with the full name `Briana Willis` and the user logon name `a-bwillis`.

<img width="433" height="374" alt="Lab 40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/051ed52a-ed78-447a-93a8-6a89ad11aa60" /></br>

Within `Briana Willis‚Äô` account properties in `Active Directory Users and Computers`, we navigated to the `Member Of` tab and added the user to the `Domain Admins` group. This granted her administrative privileges across the domain.

## üë£ STEPS THE `DEFENDER` MADE

### Step 1: Isolate the Compromised System

Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further communication with the attacker or lateral movement.

### Step 2: Run Antivirus and Anti-Malware Scans

Use updated security software to detect and remove known malware.

### Step 3: Analyze Suspicious Running Processes and Network Connections

Use tools like Task Manager, netstat, or Sysinternals Process Explorer to identify suspicious activity.

### Step 4: Check for Unauthorized Users or Services

Review user accounts and running services for anomalies.

### Step 5: Inspect Event Logs

Analyze Windows Event Logs and Sysmon logs for unusual or suspicious events related to the payload execution.

### Step 6: Update and Patch 

Ensure the system‚Äôs OS and applications are fully patched to close vulnerabilities.

### Step 7: Restore from Backup

If the infection is severe, restore the system to a clean backup state.

### Step 8: Implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

Use advanced tools that monitor behavior and can automate threat containment.

### Step 9: Educate Users

Promote awareness on phishing, social engineering, and the importance of keeping file name extensions enabled to avoid being tricked by disguised malicious files.

### Step 10: Document and Report Incident

Follow organizational incident response procedures to document and escalate the issue appropriately.

## üß± HARDENING THE SYSTEM

### Firewall

To strengthen the security of the system, it‚Äôs important to enable and properly configure the `Windows Firewall`, including setting strict inbound rules that only allow necessary ports and block all others.

### Windows Defender and Updates

Turning on `Windows Security` features‚Äîsuch as real-time antivirus protection, ransomware protection, and exploit mitigation‚Äîadds additional layers of defense. Ensuring that `Windows Updates` are enabled and set to install automatically helps keep the system protected against newly discovered threats and vulnerabilities. Additionally, keeping all operating system components and third-party applications updated with the latest security patches is essential.
