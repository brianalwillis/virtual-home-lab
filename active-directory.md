## OBJECTIVE

Designed and deployed a virtualized Windows domain lab using `VirtualBox`, `Windows Server 2019`, and `Windows 10` to gain hands-on experience with enterprise network infrastructure and identity management. The project focused on configuring `Active Directory`, `Group Policy`, and domain-joined `endpoints` to simulate real-world authentication, access control, and administrative workflows. This lab environment served as a foundation for practicing common security tasks, including privilege escalation prevention, user access auditing, and scripting automation with `PowerShell`.

## üë£ STEP-BY-STEP: SETTING UP THE DOMAIN CONTROLLER

### Step 1: `Virtual Machine` Creation and Provisioning

The virtual machine, named `Domain-Controller`, was configured as a domain controller using the `Windows Server 2019 ISO`. It was provisioned with 2 GB of RAM and 4 virtual CPUs to support `Active Directory` and core infrastructure services.

---

### Step 2: Configure `Network Adapters`

For networking, `Network Adapter 1` was enabled and attached to `NAT` to allow internet access. `Network Adapter 2` was connected to an `internal network` named `Test 3` to facilitate isolated communication between lab machines without external exposure.

---

### Step 3: `Windows Setup`

Powered on the virtual machine and proceeded through the Windows Server 2019 installation process using the ISO image.

<img width="636" height="476" alt="Lab 6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31f0efb0-f514-40d9-8987-d7ba2b00bff5" /></br>

---

### Step 4: Check `Network Configuration`

Checked the `network connection details` of the virtual machine and observed it was automatically assigned an IPv4 address of `169.254.120.207`, indicating an `APIPA` (Automatic Private IP Addressing) address.

<img width="357" height="434" alt="Lab 9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45c3d59a-f363-406e-b31b-a33ed6a64961" /></br>

Under `Network Connections`, we renamed the NAT adapter to `Internet` and the internal network adapter to `Internal_Network` for better clarity. The `Internet_Network` adapter was then manually configured with the following static IP settings:  
- **IP address:** `172.16.0.1`  
- **Subnet mask:** `255.255.255.0`  
- **Preferred DNS server:** `127.0.0.1`

---

### Step 5: Set Up `Active Directory`

In `Server Manager`, we began by launching the `Add Roles and Features` Wizard to install `Active Directory Domain Services` (AD DS). During the setup, we also included `Group Policy Management` and `Remote Server Administration Tools` (RSAT) to enable centralized domain control and administrative functionality.

<img width="1001" height="741" alt="Lab 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5771a04-7c98-4775-b2da-d8c923f4b627" /></br>

<img width="783" height="556" alt="Lab 22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/009e3290-608c-4122-8e58-9fac3755b499" /></br>

After completing the role installation, we proceeded with the `post-deployment configuration` by promoting the server to a domain controller. During the configuration, we created a new forest with the root domain name `mydomain.com`, and enabled both the `Domain Name System` (DNS) server and `Global Catalog` (GC) options. We also set the NetBIOS domain name to `MYDOMAIN`.

<img width="1227" height="764" alt="Lab 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba1b4759-d514-4bc1-9d9b-f6541081624d" /></br>

---

### Step 6: Set up `Domain Admins` and `Domain Users`

After logging back into the server, we navigated to `Active Directory Users and Computers` to begin configuring domain objects. We created a new `Organizational Unit` (OU) named `_ADMINS`, and within that OU, added a new user account with the full name `Briana Willis` and the user logon name `a-bwillis`.

<img width="433" height="374" alt="Lab 40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/051ed52a-ed78-447a-93a8-6a89ad11aa60" /></br>

Within `Briana Willis‚Äô` account properties in `Active Directory Users and Computers`, we navigated to the `Member Of` tab and added the user to the `Domain Admins` group. This granted her administrative privileges across the domain. 

<img width="1225" height="763" alt="Lab 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9c074da-91da-4683-9aa3-637794e44dcc" /></br>

---

### Step 7: Set up `Remote Access` Services

In `Server Manager`, we returned to `Add Roles and Features` to install the `Remote Access role`. During the setup, we selected the role services `DirectAccess and VPN` (RAS) as well as `Routing` to enable secure remote connectivity and traffic management for the network.

<img width="781" height="555" alt="Lab 49" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f3e9a0b-ac0a-4e73-baa5-1f18c2166a33" /></br>

Next, we navigated to `Tools` > `Routing and Remote Access` and launched the Routing and Remote Access Server Setup Wizard. We proceeded to configure `NAT` by selecting our internet-facing network interface, named `Internet`, to provide network address translation for internal clients. Upon successful configuration, the domain controller (local server) displayed a green status arrow, indicating the service was running properly.

<img width="616" height="437" alt="Lab 58" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2743e64b-b68c-41e4-b333-be1a7b70fd47" /></br>

---

### Step 8: Set up `DHCP Server`

Back in `Server Manager`, we launched the `Add Roles and Features` Wizard again to install the `DHCP Server` role, enabling the server to assign IP addresses dynamically within the network.

<img width="779" height="554" alt="Lab 61" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ba6c860-10d4-4a5e-b1cf-945f01291840" /></br>

We navigated to `Tools` > `DHCP` and launched the `New Scope Wizard` to configure a DHCP scope. We named the scope `172.16.0.100-200` and set the IP address range from `172.16.0.100` to `172.16.0.200` with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0` (prefix length 24). The router (default gateway) was set to `172.16.0.1`, and the parent domain was specified as `mydomain.com`. After activating, authorizing, and refreshing the DHCP server, its status displayed a green icon indicating it was functioning properly.

<img width="167" height="172" alt="Lab 77" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbfe1307-c73c-4d5b-9284-b3705fd0899e" /></br>

<img width="271" height="378" alt="Lab 78" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f484b260-c072-473e-9c35-a2888a5f4902" /></br>

---

### Step 9: Bulk User Creation with `PowerShell` in `Active Directory`

To efficiently add 1,000+ user accounts to `Active Directory`, we used a `PowerShell` script in combination with a text file containing first and last names. The script created a new organizational unit called `_USERS` and then processed each name to generate a standardized username consisting of the user‚Äôs first initial and last name in lowercase. Each user was created with a default password `Password18` and placed within the _USERS OU. This automated method significantly streamlined bulk user provisioning, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent account configuration across the domain.

**Script:**
```powershell
$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS   = "Password18" 
$USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST = Get-Content .\names.txt
# ------------------------------------------------------ #

$password = ConvertTo-SecureString $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS -AsPlainText -Force
New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name _USERS -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false

foreach ($n in $USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST) {
    $first = $n.Split(" ")[0].ToLower()
    $last = $n.Split(" ")[1].ToLower()
    $username = "$($first.Substring(0,1))$($last)".ToLower()
    Write-Host "Creating user: $($username)" -BackgroundColor Black -ForegroundColor Cyan
    
    New-AdUser -AccountPassword $password `
               -GivenName $first `
               -Surname $last `
               -DisplayName $username `
               -Name $username `
               -EmployeeID $username `
               -PasswordNeverExpires $true `
               -Path "ou=_USERS,$(([ADSI]`"").distinguishedName)" `
               -Enabled $true
}
```
**Results:**

Before running the script to create all 1,000 users, I tested its functionality by manually inserting my name `Briana Willis` as the first entry in the `names.txt` file. After executing the PowerShell script, a total of 1,001 users were created in Active Directory, confirming that the script worked as intended. The test user account `bwillis` was successfully generated using the naming convention implemented in the script, verifying that both the account creation logic and OU assignment were functioning properly.
